My project will be about linguistic data. From a json, parsing the data we are interested in and performing informational statistics + creating new documents to store this data.

Linguistic data is of the following form: target-language-sentences, traduction-into-other-languages, glose-by-morpheme, glose-by-word, parsed-morphemes, parsed-words.
